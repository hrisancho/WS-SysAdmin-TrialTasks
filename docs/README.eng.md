## WS-SysAdmin-TrialTasks

Welcome to the Cisco Packet Tracer Lessons Repository! This repository is designed for educational purposes, specifically for individuals preparing for the World Skills or Junior Network System Administration Olympiad. It contains a collection of lessons that cover various network stack technologies.

### Lesson Structure

Each lesson in this repository focuses on a specific technology and is organized into its own directory. The directory name reveals the technology used in that lesson. Inside each directory, you will find an unconfigured network and a building. Your task, as a web admin, is to set up the network according to the given task.

### Task Updates

Please note that tasks will be updated randomly as needed. This ensures that the repository remains relevant and up to date with the latest networking concepts and technologies.

### Requirements

To study and work with the lessons in this repository, you will need to have Cisco Packet Tracer version 7.3.0 installed. You can download it from [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/156VqOtrKKDdOB8TixG3E61ucWfF1cYx7/view?usp=drive_link).

### Preparation and Tips

Before you begin your training, we recommend completing the Cisco Packet Tracer "Young Fighter" course, which consists of at least 17 lessons or more. Please note that this course does not cover IPv6. If you wish to learn about IPv6, we encourage you to explore this topic on your own. Here's a helpful tip: In Packet Tracer, an IPv6-only device cannot function without at least one IPv4 interface, such as the "looback" interface.

### Additional Resources

To help you better understand the topics and set up the networks, we have compiled a list of additional sources from the Internet that we used in preparing the lessons. Feel free to explore these resources:
